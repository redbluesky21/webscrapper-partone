# Auto Web Scraper Part 1: Downloading YouTube Videos

This is the part one out of four of my web Auto scraper project, focused on automated downloading videos from YouTube (perhaps other platforms in the near future),
by given inputed keywords.
Part Two would be about reiterating the videos into other creative concept with the help of AI's.
Part Three would be distributing it to different platforms.
Part Four would wrap all the commands in the program into a sleek and easy-to-use GUI.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this part is to create a robust and automated system for searching and downloading videos from YouTube, based on user input.

## Key Features
- Automated YouTube video download based on raw URL input âœ“
- Enhanced functionality to download videos through user-provided URLs
- Intelligent video search based on user-inputted search terms
- Comprehensive check to prevent redundant downloads
- Utilization of youtube_links.csv to track downloaded video URLs efficiently
- Seamless transition to the next video search, with data cross-referencing from youtube_links.csv for download validation.

## Description
In this phase of the web scraper project, the focus is on achieving the core functionality of downloading YouTube videos automatically, both through direct URL input and by performing targeted searches based on user-defined queries. Additionally, the system is designed to maintain a record of previously downloaded video URLs to avoid duplicate downloads, thereby optimizing the process and conserving resources.

This project aims to deliver a reliable and efficient solution for downloading YouTube videos programmatically, allowing users to effortlessly acquire videos of interest by leveraging intelligent search mechanisms while maintaining data integrity and preventing repetitive downloads.

Please note that this is just the first part of the web scraper project, and further enhancements and features are planned for subsequent stages to broaden its capabilities and improve user experience. Stay tuned for updates as we progress through the development process.
